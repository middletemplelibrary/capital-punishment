# Introduction: ‘The Bloody Code’: Capital Punishment in Law and Art
This exhibition was curated in collaboration with Art Responders, a community arts organisation that develops free public exhibitions on social justice and human rights themes. The curators are Daryl Stenvoll-Wells, the founding director of Art Responders, and Lauren Cummings, Assistant Librarian at Middle Temple Library, assisted by Dr. Renae Satterley, Head of the Library.

Though its roots go back much further, the 18th century marked the beginning of developed societies’ drive towards universal abolition of the death penalty. Since then, most countries have moved in this direction, while others have instead reinforced capital punishment via new methods and justifications. While this year marks the 60th anniversary of the UK’s Murder (Abolition of the Death Penalty) Act 1965, the British use of capital punishment stretches back centuries. The history of capital punishment law lays bare persistent tensions within the nation’s political institutions and social structures and reflects larger historical shifts worldwide.
<br><br>
The UN’s 1948 Declaration of Human Rights, including the right to life, steered the international community away from the use of capital punishment. More than  two-thirds of countries have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. However, capital punishment remains remarkably resilient in the 55 nations that retain it, often employing contemporary methods that are no less cruel or unusual than those of the past.
<br><br>
Middle Temple Library’s collection offers a rich historical record of capital punishment law, tracing its evolution across the centuries through legislative documents, historical narratives, and personal accounts. Examining the historical trajectory of the death penalty enables legal professionals to situate modern legal theories of capital punishment law within the broader framework of global human rights legislation.hough its roots go back much further, the 18th century marked the beginning of developed societies’ drive towards universal abolition of the death penalty Since then, most countries have moved in this direction, while others have instead reinforced capital punishment via new methods and justifications. hough its roots go back much further, the 18th century marked the beginning of developed societies’ drive towards universal abolition of the death penal Since then, most countries have moved in this direction, while others have instead reinforced capital punishment via new methods and justifications.

## Sir Julian Knowles, The Abolition of the Death Penalty in the UK: How It Happened and Why It Still Matters (2015)
The death penalty was effectively abolished in Great Britain by the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965, which replaced the death penalty for murder with life imprisonment. While the Act left four capital offences (treason, “piracy with violence”, arson in royal dockyards and espionage), no further executions were carried out between 1965 and the final abolition of the death penalty in 1998.
<br><br>
While the 1965 Act passed in the House of Commons by 355 votes to 170, public opinion was not in favour of abolition and remains divided on the issue to this day. As Sir Julian Knowles discusses in this report, Parliament’s ultimate decision to abolish it was the result of a confluence of factors including several high-profile, controversial cases, and a Labour government that leaned more abolitionist than its opposition and the public itself.

## William Schabas, The Abolition of the Death Penalty in International Law (3rd ed., 2002)
William Schabas is a Canadian academic who specialises in the fields of international criminal and human rights law. In this acclaimed study, he outlines the progress in international law towards abolition, discussing its treatment in international criminal law, human rights law and the United Nations human rights system.  
<br><br>
In Appendix II of the book, Schabas presents two articles from the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: Article 6, which states that “Every human being has the inherent right to life”, and Article 14, covering the right to a fair and public trial. Despite declaring the inherent right to life, Article 6 does not prohibit the death penalty entirely. It restricts its use to “only for the most serious crimes […] pursuant to a final judgment rendered by a competent court” and forbids its use against children and pregnant women. As of July 2025, 24 states have not become party to the treaty, while 6 have signed but not yet ratified it.

## Laura Finley, The Death Penalty as State Crime: Who Can Kill? (2024)
This book offers a new academic perspective on the death penalty: that it is a crime committed by states against their citizens, as it infringes on their human rights. Focusing on the United States, Finley argues that the state is aware of flaws in the process such as racial bias, inadequate representation and arbitrariness, and that torturous methods are used in the application of the death penalty. 
<br><br>
One such example given is of the 2022 “Year of botched executions”, during which one in three executions in the United States was mishandled. In one case, that of Joe N. James in Alabama, prison staff performing the lethal injection attempted 11 times to inset an IV into his veins, causing serious bruising. An autopsy funded by the non-profit organisation Reprieve US showed an incision indicating that his arm had eventually been cut to expose the vein. It took three hours for James to die.

<br><br>

## Richard Michael Rossi, Waiting to Die: Life on Death Row (2004)
Lethal injection is the most common method of execution in the United States. It was first approved in Oklahoma and Texas in 1977 and was seen as a more humane method of execution than electrocution or hanging. There have however been several instances of botched executions involving the injection. The drugs are administered intravenously, and issues can arise where a vein cannot be easily located (such as when prisoners are intravenous drug users); in these cases, a scalpel is used to cut the arm or leg to find a vein, often without anaesthesia. In Waiting to Die, Rossi quotes from a New York Times article from 9th June 2000, which recounts the case of Bennie Demps, who was subjected to such a ‘cutdown’: 
<br><br>
“‘They butchered me back there,’ Demps said. ‘I was in a lot of pain. They cut me in the groin, they cut me in the leg, I was bleeding profusely. This is not an execution, this is murder.’”

## William Schabas, The Death Penalty as Cruel Treatment and Torture: Capital Punishment Challenged in the World's Courts (1996)
In one section of this book, Schabas discusses ways in which those condemned to the death penalty have attempted to hasten their eventual fate. Socrates famously asked to be brought poison before his execution, believing that he would “become ridiculous in my own eyes for clinging to life” any longer. The UK’s Royal Commission on Capital Punishment considered offering prisoners a lethal dose of poison the night before their executions, but concluded that this would not be appropriate:
<br><br>
“The purpose of capital punishment is not just to rid the community of an unwanted member; it is to mark the community’s denunciation of the gravest of all crimes by subjecting the perpetrator, in the form of law, to the severest of all punishments.”
<br><br>

## L. Benson ed., The Book of Remarkable Trials and Notorious Characters (1876)
This work could be considered an early example of a ‘true crime’ publication, with its accounts of sensational trials and criminals that captured the public’s imagination. The story of ‘Half-Hanged Smith’ is one recorded instance where a prisoner survived being hanged. John Smith was sentenced to death for burglary in 1705 and his hanging scheduled for 24th December. He was cut down after fifteen minutes of hanging and quickly revived; his vivid account of the physical experience of being hanged can be read from the bottom of page 30. Smith dodged death twice more and was eventually transported to Virginia.

## James B. Christoph, Capital Punishment and British Politics: the British Movement to Abolish the Death Penalty 1945-57 (1962)
This Gallup survey from May 1948 demonstrates the strength of feeling on capital punishment at the time, and the extent to which the public did not favour abolition. The number of respondents who chose “Don’t Know” is remarkably low for all groups, and even supporters of the Labour government of the time tended to disapprove of the experiment.
<br><br>
Recent polling by YouGov (21st July 2025) indicates that the public is somewhat more uncertain than it was in 1948. When asked if they would support the reintroduction of capital punishment for all cases of murder, 46% responded they would oppose it, 36% that they would support it, and 18% were unsure. Just as in 1948, age and gender do not affect the results significantly, but political party plays a notably greater role: 65% of Labour voters would oppose reintroduction, compared to 39% of Conservative voters.

## The Newgate Calendar, vol III
The Newgate Calendar was a title given to various publications about crime and punishment in England in the 18th and 19th centuries, named after Newgate Prison in London. The stories in the Newgate Calendar were highly editorialised accounts of infamous crimes and the people who committed them. This volume forms part of an edition titled The Complete Newgate Calendar that was printed for the Navarre Society in 1926.
<br><br>
Sarah Malcolm was a young woman who worked as a laundress and maid in the Temple area. Her employers included Mrs Lydia Duncomb, an elderly widow who lived in Tanfield Court, in the area now occupied by Inner Temple Library. Mrs Duncomb was found murdered on 4th February 1733 along with two women she shared her home with. Some of her possessions had been stolen. Malcolm was arrested when another of her employers found items with blood on them among her possessions, and money was found hidden in her cap following her transfer to Newgate Prison. Malcolm confessed to planning the robbery with three accomplices but claimed her role was to keep watch on the stairs and that she was not aware that the women had been killed until the following day. Nonetheless, she was found guilty of murder and sentenced to be hanged.
<br><br>
The case caused a sensation due to Malcolm’s sex and age – she was just 22 at the time of the murders. While she was in prison awaiting her execution, she was sketched by William Hogarth, which further increased her notoriety. As illustrated in this plate from the Newgate Calendar, a large crowd came to watch her execution in Fleet Street in early March 1733. She is said to have been left briefly struggling and kicking the air before her death.

## George Ryley Scott, The History of Capital Punishment (1950)
Robert Johnston was executed in Edinburgh in 1818. Johnston had been convicted of robbery and his hanging in Edinburgh’s Lawnmarket was botched: the executioner miscalculated the length of the rope and the table on which Johnston was standing did not break. The watching crowd were so incensed by the sight of Johnston’s struggling that they threw stones at the police and cut him down. When order was restored after the arrival of the military, Johnston was executed at the same place in a similarly brutal manner: the Newgate Calendar describes “his face uncovered, and one of his hands broke loose from the cords […] his fingers convulsively twisting in the noose.”
<br><br>

# International Practices and Perspectives
Despite indications that capital punishment’s flaws outweigh advocates’ evidence in favour of the practice, executions continue in around 55 nations around the world. Most executions occur in states notorious for human rights abuses, such as China, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. These countries are known for targeting ethnic minorities, state critics and protestors, often rendering capital verdicts for non-violent crimes.
<br><br>
However, the United States and Japan are also among the 55 remaining nations that continue to carry out executions. The United States is alone among Western democracies in its continued practice of the death penalty, with over two thousand prisoners currently on death row.  Contemporary theorists have claimed that the death penalty is more easily reinforced in societies with pronounced social and economic inequality.  Societies fractured by social distance and weakened communal bonds provide fertile ground for repressive penal policies, including long-term incarceration and capital punishment.
<br><br>
One of the volumes here discusses Norway’s refusal to re-institute the death penalty after a horrific 2011 crime by an anti-immigrant extremist.  The country’s steadfast commitment to prevention and rehabilitation —and its resistance to retributive impulses — are seen by some as naïve and by others as admirable. Reactions to this punishment could serve as a bellwether for public attitudes toward the death penalty worldwide.

## Lilli Scherdin ed., Capital Punishment: A Hazard to a Sustainable Criminal Justice System? (2014)
The United Nations General Assembly has adopted several resolutions calling for an international moratorium on capital punishment since 2007. These resolutions are not binding, and call on states that retain the death penalty to suspend its use with a view to abolition. This table lists the states that voted against the fourth such resolution in 2012. Since then there have been six further resolutions; the most recent in 2024 saw 32 countries vote against the resolution, a reduction of 10 from 2012.

## Rita James Simon, A Comparative Analysis of Capital Punishment (2002)
One argument for capital punishment is that it acts as a deterrent to the most serious crimes like murder. Several studies have attempted to determine whether this is the case, but problems arise when comparing countries with and without the death penalty as wider socio-economic factors may strongly influence crime rates and often cannot be directly compared. Generally, though, studies have not shown capital punishment to be an effective deterrent. These tables from a 1983 study present the homicide rates in 14 different jurisdictions before and after the abolition of the death penalty; they do not show a consistent effect across the countries.

## Edward Fitzgerald CBE KC and Sir Keir Starmer KC, A Guide to Sentencing in Capital Cases (2007)
The Death Penalty Project is a legal action charity that provides free legal representation to people facing the death penalty around the world. Since its establishment in 1990 it has fought several significant cases that have contributed to the abolition of capital punishment in Caribbean countries. This document, written for the Project in 2007, serves as a practical sentencing guide for judges and lawyers in jurisdictions that retain the death penalty, including where it is no longer a mandatory sentence.

## Lord David Pannick KC, Judicial Review of the Death Penalty (1982)
In some countries where the death penalty is retained, it is imposed as a mandatory punishment for certain crimes. This prevents judges from taking into account any mitigating circumstances when sentencing. Pannick uses examples from Singapore and Pakistan to argue that mandatory sentencing conflicts with the rights guaranteed by a written constitution, as it fails to ensure fair and reasonable treatment under the law.

## Mai Sato & Paul Bacon, The Public Opinion Myth: Why Japan Retains the Death Penalty (2015)
In June 2025, serial killer Takahiro Shiraishi was hanged in Japan, marking the country’s first execution in three years. Conditions on death row in Japan have been heavily criticised by campaigners, as inmates are kept in solitary confinement and are typically only given a few hours’ notice of their execution. The Japanese government surveys the public on the topic every five years, with the most recently available results from March 2025 finding that 83.1% of respondents find the death penalty to be “unavoidable”. In this report, however, Sato and Bacon argue that the public form their opinions on the topic based on limited information and conclude that abolition would be embraced if the government were to change its stance.

# Disproportionality, Diminished Responsibility, & Other Miscarriages of Justice
The history of death penalty legislation reveals numerous undeniable injustices, often rooted in the social prejudices and flawed penal systems of their time. In 18th century Britain, political opponents of the ruling class and people of lower social status were disproportionately targeted for the death penalty, while the wealthy were often able to escape judgement for similar crimes.
<br><br>
In the United States, South Africa, and other nations with histories of codified racial discrimination, racial minorities have been far more likely to receive capital verdicts. Globally, women perceived as violating established norms of gendered behaviour are more likely to receive the death penalty, even in cases with evidence of gender-based violence such as domestic abuse. Although individuals with mental illness may struggle to understand their rights or the consequences of their pleas, the US has no official ban on their execution, and rates of serious mental illness and intellectual disabilities are higher among people on death row than in the general population.
<br><br>
Many stories and statistics in the Library’s collections document known miscarriages of justice, reinforcing the central argument against capital punishment: that the death penalty exposes societies’ systemic injustices more than it functions as a direct response to, or deterrent against, crime.

## Saundra D. Westervelt and John A. Humphrey eds., Wrongly Convicted: Perspectives on Failed Justice (2002)
This table presents the numbers of wrongful convictions found at retrial in the United States (at the time of publication). While clear variations can be seen between states, almost one quarter of defendants in capital cases sent for retrial were then found not guilty, highlighting the clear and significant risk that an innocent person could be executed.

# Helen Prejean, The Death of Innocents: an Eyewitness Account of Wrongful Executions (2005)
Sister Helen Prejean is a Catholic religious nun who has been working with inmates on Death Row since the early 1980s. In The Death of Innocents, Prejean focuses on the cases of Joseph Roger O’Dell and Dobie Gillis Williams, both of whom she accompanied to their executions – and both of whom she believes to have been innocent. Prejean uses withheld evidence to argue their innocence, demonstrates the roles played by factors like race, poverty, politicking and publicity in capital convictions, and ultimately challenges the moral core of the death penalty itself by asking how we can ever justify the execution of the innocent
