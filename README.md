## Introduction: ‘The Bloody Code’: Capital Punishment in Law and Art
This exhibition was curated in collaboration with Art Responders, a community arts organisation that develops free public exhibitions on social justice and human rights themes. The curators are Daryl Stenvoll-Wells, the founding director of Art Responders, and Lauren Cummings, Assistant Librarian at Middle Temple Library, assisted by Dr. Renae Satterley, Head of the Library.

Though its roots go back much further, the 18th century marked the beginning of developed societies’ drive towards universal abolition of the death penalty. Since then, most countries have moved in this direction, while others have instead reinforced capital punishment via new methods and justifications. While this year marks the 60th anniversary of the UK’s Murder (Abolition of the Death Penalty) Act 1965, the British use of capital punishment stretches back centuries. The history of capital punishment law lays bare persistent tensions within the nation’s political institutions and social structures and reflects larger historical shifts worldwide.
<br><br>
The UN’s 1948 Declaration of Human Rights, including the right to life, steered the international community away from the use of capital punishment. More than  two-thirds of countries have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. However, capital punishment remains remarkably resilient in the 55 nations that retain it, often employing contemporary methods that are no less cruel or unusual than those of the past.
<br><br>
Middle Temple Library’s collection offers a rich historical record of capital punishment law, tracing its evolution across the centuries through legislative documents, historical narratives, and personal accounts. Examining the historical trajectory of the death penalty enables legal professionals to situate modern legal theories of capital punishment law within the broader framework of global human rights legislation.hough its roots go back much further, the 18th century marked the beginning of developed societies’ drive towards universal abolition of the death penalty Since then, most countries have moved in this direction, while others have instead reinforced capital punishment via new methods and justifications. hough its roots go back much further, the 18th century marked the beginning of developed societies’ drive towards universal abolition of the death penal Since then, most countries have moved in this direction, while others have instead reinforced capital punishment via new methods and justifications.

## Sir Julian Knowles, The Abolition of the Death Penalty in the UK: How It Happened and Why It Still Matters (2015)
The death penalty was effectively abolished in Great Britain by the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965, which replaced the death penalty for murder with life imprisonment. While the Act left four capital offences (treason, “piracy with violence”, arson in royal dockyards and espionage), no further executions were carried out between 1965 and the final abolition of the death penalty in 1998.
<br><br>
While the 1965 Act passed in the House of Commons by 355 votes to 170, public opinion was not in favour of abolition and remains divided on the issue to this day. As Sir Julian Knowles discusses in this report, Parliament’s ultimate decision to abolish it was the result of a confluence of factors including several high-profile, controversial cases, and a Labour government that leaned more abolitionist than its opposition and the public itself.

## William Schabas, The Abolition of the Death Penalty in International Law (3rd ed., 2002)
William Schabas is a Canadian academic who specialises in the fields of international criminal and human rights law. In this acclaimed study, he outlines the progress in international law towards abolition, discussing its treatment in international criminal law, human rights law and the United Nations human rights system.  
<br><br>
In Appendix II of the book, Schabas presents two articles from the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: Article 6, which states that “Every human being has the inherent right to life”, and Article 14, covering the right to a fair and public trial. Despite declaring the inherent right to life, Article 6 does not prohibit the death penalty entirely. It restricts its use to “only for the most serious crimes […] pursuant to a final judgment rendered by a competent court” and forbids its use against children and pregnant women. As of July 2025, 24 states have not become party to the treaty, while 6 have signed but not yet ratified it.

## Laura Finley, The Death Penalty as State Crime: Who Can Kill? (2024)
This book offers a new academic perspective on the death penalty: that it is a crime committed by states against their citizens, as it infringes on their human rights. Focusing on the United States, Finley argues that the state is aware of flaws in the process such as racial bias, inadequate representation and arbitrariness, and that torturous methods are used in the application of the death penalty. 
<br><br>
One such example given is of the 2022 “Year of botched executions”, during which one in three executions in the United States was mishandled. In one case, that of Joe N. James in Alabama, prison staff performing the lethal injection attempted 11 times to inset an IV into his veins, causing serious bruising. An autopsy funded by the non-profit organisation Reprieve US showed an incision indicating that his arm had eventually been cut to expose the vein. It took three hours for James to die.
